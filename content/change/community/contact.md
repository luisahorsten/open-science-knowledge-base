# How can I find out what's going on in the open science world?

**The Open Science community is a vibrant, friendly and collaborative group** of people working together to improve psychological science. Many discussions take place in the open, and there is always a lot going on. How can we keep up with the latest developments?

## Social media

Much of the day-to-day chatter can be found on social media:

* [**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/) provides a never-ending firehose of discussions. The [@OpenScience](https://twitter.com/openscience) account often collects news and articles regarding Open Science across disciplines; the organizations below are also represented. If you follow some voices you find interesting, you'll likely soon get a feeling for ongoing discussions.
* [**Facebook**](https://facebook.com/) also hosts some forums related to open science, though less so. An active group in the realm of methodology and statistics is [PsychMAP](https://www.facebook.com/groups/psychmap/about/).
* **Blogs** reflect individual opinions in a longer format. You might enjoy the [100% CI](http://www.the100.ci/), Simine Vazire's [Sometimes I'm Wrong](http://sometimesimwrong.typepad.com/) or [Felix Sch√∂nbrodt's blog](http://www.nicebread.de/)?
* **Podcasts** can be great for casual listening to discussions. Examples you might find interesting are the [Open Science Radio](http://www.openscienceradio.org/category/english-episodes/) or [The Black Goat](http://www.theblackgoatpodcast.com). Sau-Chin Chen put together an [overview of further psychology podcasts](http://scchen.com/en/post/ps-podcasts/) that are hosted by Open Science Promoters.

    Academic social media is great at giving voice to a wide and diverse group of people, but dealing with the deluge of information can be exhausting. It's hard if not impossible to keep up, and everybody seems to be working so hard and achieving so much! As much as the banter can be uplifting, it can at times be depressing.

    * The members of the podcast [The Black Goat](http://www.theblackgoatpodcast.com), themselves veteran prolific tweeps, discuss the [**blooming, buzzing confusion**](http://www.theblackgoatpodcast.com/posts/a-blooming-buzzing-confusion/) that is social media.
    * Dorothy Bishop lays out [**a simple rule to reduce stress**](https://deevybee.blogspot.com/2018/05/how-to-survive-on-twitter-simple-rule.html) caused by unpleasant and negative messages.

## Organizations

There are several organizations that have made it their mission to foster open science, especially in the field of psychology:

* The [**Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science**](http://improvingpsych.org/) \(SIPS\) is a grass-roots initiative to improve research practices on both an individual \(through training and outreach\) and institutional level. SIPS organize an [annual meeting](http://improvingpsych.org/meetings/) which focusses on collaboration in the service of open science.
* The [**Center for Open Science**](https://cos.io/) runs the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/), and provides several related services around [preprints](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-preprints/), [open conference materials](https://cos.io/our-products/osf-meetings/), and similar efforts. The COS is represented through a worldwide network of [ambassadors](https://cos.io/our-communities/become-ambassador/).

??? seealso "Local initiatives"
    Besides larger organisations, there are several local, university-level initiatives. The German network of open-science initiatives maintains a [list of local working groups](https://osf.io/tbkzh/wiki/home/) in Germany and beyond.
